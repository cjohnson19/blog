ReachU is a mobile application that helps users connect with mental health
resources. We've partnered with [Lost&Found](https://resilienttoday.org/) to
help facilitate their
[Peer2Peer](https://resilienttoday.org/programs/student-programs/peer2peer-mentorship/)
program.


The app is built with [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/) and is hosted on
[AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/). We use an almost fully serverless architecture.

ReachU is currently available at over a dozen universities across the United States.
