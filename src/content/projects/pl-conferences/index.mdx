A simple website which lists the dates and deadlines of programming languages
conferences. The focus is on creating a fast lightweight website to see the
deadlines for all various conferences and workshops in one place. It offers a
calendar download to add main conference dates as well as all of the deadlines.

The website is built using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org), with the
infrastructure being maintained by [SST](https://sst.dev).
